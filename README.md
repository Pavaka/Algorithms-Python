# Algorithms-Python
Library containing algorithms that solve math related problems.
To use the library you just need to import the algorithms module
or some part of its content and use the desired algorithm function.
 Install with:
 -pip install Algorithms
 Example usage
 - from algoritthms.knapsack_problem_DP import knapsack_problem_DP as KPDP 

The library contains:

Optimization algorithms:
- Knapsack problem solved with dynamic programming approach
- Knapsack problem solved with branch and bound approach
- Change making problem solved with dynamic programming approach
- Change making problem solved with greedy algorithm approach 
- Transportation problem solved with transportation table (Currently not working)
- Simplex method for solving minimization problem with trivial starting vertecie (Currently not working)
- Algorithm for converting a linear optimization problem
  into canonical form or in Big M method form. (Currently not working)
- Algrorithm that takes a linear optimization problem in 
  Max/Min form and transforms it into the corresponding dual Min/Max form (Currently not working)
