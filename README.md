# Pygorithms
Library containing algorithms that solve math related problems.
To use the library you just need to import the algorithms module
or some part of its content and use the desired algorithm function.

Install, with terminal open in the package directory use command:
 - python setup.py install

Example usage:
 - from pygorithms.knapsack_problem_DP import knapsack_problem_DP as KPDP 

The library contains:

Optimization algorithms:
- Knapsack problem solved with dynamic programming approach
- Knapsack problem solved with branch and bound approach
- Change making problem solved with dynamic programming approach
- Change making problem solved with greedy algorithm approach 
- Simplex method for solving minimization problem with trivial starting vertecie 
- Transportation problem solved with transportation table (Currently not working)
- Algorithm for converting a linear optimization problem
  into canonical form or in Big M method form.
