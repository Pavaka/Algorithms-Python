# Algorithms-Python
Library containing algorithms that solve math related problems.
The library contains:

Optimization algorithms:
- Knapsack problem solved with dynamic programming approach
- Knapsack problem solved with branch and bound approach
- Change making problem solved with dynamic programming approach (Currently not working)
- Change making problem solved with greedy algorithm approach (Currently not working)
- Transportation problem solved with transportation table (Currently not working)
- Simplex method for solving minimization problem with trivial starting vertecie (Currently not working)
- Algorithm for converting a linear optimization problem
  into canonical form or in Big M method. (Currently not working)
- Algrorithm that takes a linear optimization problem in 
  Max/Min form and transforms it into the corresponding Min/Max form (Currently not working)
